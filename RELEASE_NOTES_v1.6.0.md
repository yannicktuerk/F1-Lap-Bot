# 🏁 F1 Lap Bot v1.6.0 Release Notes
*Released: 2025-07-24*

## 🔧 CRITICAL FIX: Username Consistency Issue Resolved

### 🚨 The Problem
Previously, when users changed their display name using `/lap username <name>`, all existing lap times would correctly update to show the new name. However, **new lap time submissions would still use the Discord display name instead of the custom username**, causing inconsistency in leaderboards and legends.

**Example:**
- User "Max123" sets custom name with `/lap username Max`
- All old times show "Max" ✅ 
- New submissions show "Max123" ❌ (inconsistent!)

### ✅ The Solution
**Complete username consistency system implemented:**

1. **Intelligent Username Resolution**
   - Bot now checks for existing custom usernames before each submission
   - Falls back gracefully: Custom Username → ELO Rating Username → Discord Display Name

2. **Persistent Custom Names**
   - Once set with `/lap username`, your custom name persists for ALL future submissions
   - No more reverting to Discord display names after username changes

3. **Smart Fallback System**
   ```
   Priority Order:
   1. Username from existing lap times (most recent)
   2. Username from ELO rating data
   3. Discord display name (fallback for new users)
   ```

### 🛡️ Additional Security & Quality Improvements

- **Bot Detection:** Added protection to prevent bots from submitting lap times
- **Database Enhancement:** New `is_bot` field for better data integrity
- **Code Architecture:** Clean implementation following SOLID principles

## 🔧 Technical Implementation

### New Functions Added:
- `_get_user_display_name()` - Smart username resolution with fallback
- Enhanced `submit_lap_time()` - Now uses consistent username logic
- Database migration for `is_bot` field with safe column addition

### Code Quality:
- **Clean Architecture:** Maintains separation of concerns
- **Error Handling:** Graceful fallbacks ensure no submission failures
- **Performance:** Minimal impact on submission speed
- **Backwards Compatible:** Existing data remains unaffected

## 🎯 User Experience Impact

### Before v1.6.0:
```
1. User "Max123" submits time → Shows "Max123" ✅
2. User runs /lap username Max → All old times show "Max" ✅
3. User submits new time → Shows "Max123" ❌ (inconsistent!)
```

### After v1.6.0:
```
1. User "Max123" submits time → Shows "Max123" ✅
2. User runs /lap username Max → All old times show "Max" ✅
3. User submits new time → Shows "Max" ✅ (consistent!)
```

## 🚀 What This Means for Users
